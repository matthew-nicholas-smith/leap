# theworkingtitlegame
We know you're on your phone playing games instead of sleeping. Why not both?
#
A game with action and puzzles and art and more

all to the tune of your slowly growing snore

as the blackness fades in from the edges of the screen,

you will finish in the morning, in your dreams, or inbetween

launching blocks and bananas and yourself through space

for manufacturing research for the whole human race

you can traverse throughout time to help yourself solve the leap

all while slowly falling asleep
